This project was conducted by me when I was in sophomore year (Fall 2022), in Multi-tier Application course with the idea given by my professor. Using Microsoft Visual Studio to run the application.
During the project conduction, I have not followed the steps and procedure in the PDF given since there are some confusions and unclear points; however I believe it will not be too hard to understand my codes.


Belowed is the description of all directories and files included in my project, please refer to the two PDFs project_description to get all the ideas:
The folder ETS LIBRARY is my code library which is referenced in my application.
The folder ETS SYSTEM is my application in which contains .sln file to run the application.
The file-note.txt is a text file of all initial data (sponsors, donors, prizes and donation) needed to test my functions and buttons.
